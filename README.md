# GenderPrediction
Project is Gender Prediction using Computer Vision and Machine Learning 
In this project i have use the concept of face recognisation through Computer vision and Machine Learning and have 
got the accuracy around 70% but still it is not a very good accuracy we can more emphasize its quality via using Neaural network and deep Learning 
in this project I have used some inbuilt libraries for face prediction 
in future may the version change and the librarie will not support for this one
